	Down deep in the valleys, the trolls dance.	
	
	Under the stars, lit by their camp fire. Singing their songs of delicious 
	meals, and the horrors of their victims.
	
	"Did, did ye ere that wee lass?" 
	"No, what did she say?"
	"She sed, don eat me plis! I'll do anyfing!"
	"HAHAHA, hoomans, so scared."
